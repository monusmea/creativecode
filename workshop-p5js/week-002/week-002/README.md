## Folder Structure
The examples can be found in the numbered folders, from 000 to 014. An html file + a corresponding _sketch.js_ file can be found in each directory, sometimes accompanied with other js files.

000 - 007 : basic interaction & environmental methods, structure, the flow of programming
008 - 014 : data related problems & solutions. plot, iterate, extract, etc.

_common_ folder: files that are shared across many examples
_libs_ folder: function libraries that the examples are based on
